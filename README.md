## About Me
I'm a Data Engineer at [Disney Streaming](https://www.disneyplus.com/).

I received my Master's in Data Science & Engineering from CUNY City College in 2020. My Master's [thesis](https://github.com/tduffy000/ccny-masters-thesis) was focused on performing Speaker Verification on an Arduino Nano. 

Oh, and I built my own website on GCP using Hugo, and all the code is here on [GitHub](https://github.com/tduffy000/my-site)!

I'm a regular contributor to [KFServing](https://github.com/tduffy000?org=kubeflow) and I'm super interested in building reliable, reproducible, easy-to-use MLOps systems.
