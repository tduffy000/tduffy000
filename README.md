## About Me

### Work 
I'm a Data Engineer at [Stash](https://www.stash.com/) where I get to work at the cutting edge of FinTech and Data technologies.

### Play
Currently, I'm  working to finish my Master's Thesis by putting a speaker verification model onto an Arduino microcontroller! I also built my own [website](https://www.thomasduffy.io) and all the code is right here in [GitHub](https://github.com/tduffy000/my-site)!
