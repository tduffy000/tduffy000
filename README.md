## About Me
I'm a Data Engineer at [Disney Streaming](https://www.disneyplus.com/).

### Personal Projects
- [`thomasduffy.io`](https://thomasduffy.io) is my own personal website / blog. It's a roll-your-own code situation, and it's all in the [repo](https://github.com/tduffy000/my-site)
- My [Master's Thesis](https://github.com/tduffy000/ccny-masters-thesis) on text-independent Speaker verification on microcontrollers.
- A long-term (super WIP) attempt to write a pure Rust chess engine, [`lasker`](https://github.com/tduffy000/kfserving-uri-examples).
- [`torchmnist`](https://github.com/tduffy000/torch-mobile-mnist), a simple Android app to draw hand written digits and predict them using PyTorch.
- Finally, [my attempt](https://github.com/tduffy000/learn-systems) at self-teaching system design and other foundational principles, given that I didn't study Computer Science in college.

### Open Source
- In the past, I have contributed to the [`KFServing` project](https://github.com/tduffy000?org=kubeflow) and provide a [set of examples](https://github.com/tduffy000/kfserving-uri-examples) for deploying models using those changes
